## Installation

> _Installing the package requires Go 1.21+_

To install the package, simply run:

```bash
go get github.com/AstraBert/workflows-go
```

Or, if you want to get the package from source, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AstraBert/workflows-go
cd workflows-go
```

And include the code as a base for your project's workflows!

## Import Patterns

After you installed the package, importing is very easy:

```go
import "github.com/AstraBert/workflows-go"
```

You can then use the package as `workflowsgo`
