## Definition

**Interface**

`GenericWorkflow` is an interface providing a generic implementation of
an event-driven workflow. Every struct representing a workflow should
implement the `GenericWorkflow` interface.

A workflow should be composed of steps, functions that take a `GenericEvent` and `GenericContext` as arguments: these steps should be in some way associated with strings representing their names.

**Methods**

- `TakeStep`: Allows separate execution of single steps. It executes a step by selecting it with its name and passing a `GenericEvent` and a `GenericContext` to it.
- `Validate`: Ensures that the structure of the workflow is correct.
- `Run`: Runs the workflow until completion. It takes an input event and an initial context, as well as three callback functions: for when an event starts being processed, for when a new event is emitted, and for the workflow output.
- `Output`: Runs at the end of the workflow and returns the actual workflow output.

## Source Code

```go
type GenericWorkflow interface {
	TakeStep(string, *GenericEvent, *GenericContext) *BaseEvent
	Validate() bool
	Run(*GenericEvent, *GenericContext, func(*GenericEvent), func(*GenericEvent), func(any))
	Output(*GenericEvent, *GenericContext) any
}
```
