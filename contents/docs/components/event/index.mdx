## Definition

**Interface**

`GenericEvent` is an interface that must be implemented by all structures representing events if they want to be considered as correct input/output for a workflow.

**Methods**

- `Get` is a function that fetches data stored within an Event, and returns that data. Data should be stored with strings as keys.

## Source Code

```go
type GenericEvent interface {
	Get(string) (any, bool)
}
```
