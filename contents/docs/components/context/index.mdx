## Definition

**Interface**

`GenericContext` is the interface representing a context, i.e. a storage space that is aimed at allowing persistency and stefulness for workflow executions. All structures representing a workflow context should implement this interface.

**Methods**

- `StoreValue` is aimed at persistant storage of a key-value pair.
- `GetValue` retrieves the value associated with a key within the persistent storage
- `GetState` retrieves the in-BaseContext state of the workflow run.
- `SetState` allows to set a new state within the BaseContext.

## Source Code

```go 
type GenericContext interface {
	StoreValue(string, any)
	GetValue(string) (any, bool)
	GetState() map[string]any
	SetState(map[string]any)
}
```
